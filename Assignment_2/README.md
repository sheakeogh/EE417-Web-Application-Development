This is my submission for Assignment 2. In this submission I have all the .html and .css files, and the folder with all the media used.

The first page of the website is the welcome.html page. This is just a holding page. Once you click the button you are brought to the home page. 

The home page has a brief intro into the idea of the web application. It also has some links for the user to follow easily to navigate around the site. Including the links in the body there is a navbar and a footer which allows the user to navigate the site with ease. 

The forSale.html site contains all the products which are for sale. For the time being stock images with prices and a button to add to cart. User listings are not fuinctional as of yet. 

The sell.html page gives the user an insight in how to simply upload there products to sell on the site. This page is acessed by the dropdown menu from the My Account tab on the navbar. On this site there is a button which allows the user to list their product for sale. This brings the user to the upload.html page.

The upload.html page has an option to upload an image to the site, it has a number of fields to upload the info about the item. When the user wants to list the item they click the button. This then brings them to the viewAccount.html page. When the form is submitted each field is checked, if there is a field missing then an alert appears with a prompt. The forms data is stored in the local storage.

The viewAccount.html page displays the users personal account. It has a profile picture, name, bio, and has all the list items. If the user hasn't listed any items for sale, it will display so. 

The about.html page displays the details about the people in charge of the company. The three chiefs of the company have their images, title, and a brief description of their role within the company.

The contact.html page contains a few text boxes which allow the user to contact the company. They can submit their name, email, location, and information on why they are reaching out. When the form is submitted each field is checked, if there is a field missing then an alert appears with a prompt. The forms data is stored in the local storage.

The stored data page has two tables listing data from each form.

The header has some animations for a more dynamic menu. The footer also a new link DOM Tree which prints the DOM Tree below the footer when clicked.
